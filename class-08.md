# CSS Layout Round 2

[Back to Main Page](README.md)

- EVERYTHING IS STILL A BLOCK (except for inline elements)

- normal position each new block appears on a new row

- relative position compares to where it would normally be placed

- absolute tells that block exactly where to go

- fixed stays in the same spot on screen no matter what

- floating elements are removed from the normal flow and make other boxes work around them

## Layouts Designs

- web pages should be designed to be about 960 pixels wide to account for mobile devices

- fixed width layouts don't change size with screen potentially forcing the user to pan and scroll more than they would like

- liquid layouts adjust to the size of the screen but unless coded and test thoroughly can result in unexpected issues

- fixed width layouts use pixels

- liquid layouts use percentages

- layout grids are essentially wireframes for css that you implement directly into your style sheet

## Big Takeaways

- use `<div>` to section together element that will be together on page

- elements will display in normal flow unless you specify

- float moves things left to right and enables columns to be used

- pages will either by fixed or dynamic

- top 600 px are the most important part of your web page

- use grids to make pretty, consistent designs

- you can have as many style sheets on one page as you want

- Frameworks give steps for common tasks
