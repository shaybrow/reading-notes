# Chart.js, Canvas

[Back to Main Page](README.md)

## Charts.js

- this is a javascript plugin which utilizes HTML5 canvas elements to create a graph

- you'll need to download the plugin to use it

- first thing you'll do is draw the chart

- next you'll retreive the contents of the chart

- then you'll create your data

- then you chose and draw the type of chart you would like

## Canvas Basics

- canvas is similar to an image except doesn't contain a source

- it's only attributes are width and height

- you can tell older web browsers to display something else instead of the canvas if it's not able to be displayed

- the canvas element does require a closing tag

- once the canvas has been created, you can use coordinates to draw things on it

- you can easily draw simple shapes such as rectangles and triangles and even move the pen without drawing so things don't look like an etcha sketch

- once you have your shapes the way you want you can apply color and textures to various pieces of the canvas

- you can also change the styling on lines and shapes

- not to be left out you can also draw words in a whole host of fonts on a canvas
