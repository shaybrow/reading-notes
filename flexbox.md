# MUSTACHE and FLEXBOX

[Back to Main Page](README.md)

## Mustache

- a logic-less template syntax

- renders client-side templates with JS using JSON data source

- logic-less b.c no if, else or for statements

- not a templating engine, a specification for templating

## Flexbox

- attempts to provide a more effiecient method for laying out aligning and distributing space among items in a container even when the size needs to be dynamic

- give the container the ability to change it's child's width and height

- intended for components of an application and small scale layouts

### Basics

- laid out following `main axis` from `main-start` to `main-end` and `cross-start` to `cross-end`

- main axis is the primary line where flex items are laid out 

- main size is a flex tiems width or height

### Display

- defines a flex container

### Order

- dictates the order items appear in the flex container (default is source order)

### Flex-direction

- dictates the direction of the main axis 

- default is left to right

### Flex-wrap

- default will attempt to fit all items onto 1 line

- wrap will wrap onto multiple lines

### Justify Content

- defines alignment along the main axis
