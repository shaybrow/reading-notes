# JQuery, Events and the DOM

[Back to Main Page](README.md)

jquery is an easy way to acheive a bunch of JS tasks easy and efficiently. It works on all major browsers and no fallback code is required. It's biggest shortcut is allowing us to use CSS style selectors to find different parts of HTML and then use jquery methods to manipulate that HTML. You can use jquery to select single or mulitple elements. These can be stored in variables to manipulate or add to the DOM later. Because you can select multiple elements without additional instruction this is known as implicit iteration.
