## Building a Site

### The Process

1. Identify target audience

- Who are they?
- What do they like?
- How old are they?
- How do they access the internet?

1. Why would they go to your website?

- To be entertained?
- To learn something?
- To buy something?

1. What info do they want?

- What's different from other sites?
- Do they know what they're looking at?
- What are FAQs?

1. How much do they visit?

- Is this a subscription?
- Does the subject change often

### Site Maps

The goal is to create an outline of the content that will appear on the site and how it may be navigated with ease.

### Wireframes

A rough outline of how an individual page should look and where key info should be located.

### Visual Hierarchy

- Size: make important stuff bigger
- Color: highlight key information
- Style: draw attention through contrast

### Navigation

- Concise: don't be too wordy
- Clear: don't make your user guess
- Selective: should only show different sections

## Structure

### Big Concepts

All html starts with `<html>` and ends with `</html>` and contains a `<title>` and `<body>`.

### Tags

All visible text will be contained by tags

- `<h1></h1>` Header 1
- `<h2></h2>` Header 2
- `<h3></h3>` Header 3
- `<p></p>` Paragragh

### Attributes

Attributes give us additional info about it's contents and contain a name and a value.

## HTML 5 

HTML 5 provides us with new options that allow us to dictate the layout of a webpage 

### Header and Footer

These appear at the top and bottom of the page. You might put your site nav in the header and your privacy policy in the footer.

### Nav

This is where you'll place major navigational elements.

### Article

This is where you will place content the could stand by itself as a quote, snippet or reference.

### Sections and Div

This is an easy way to group related content together.

## Extra Markup

You'll use this to tell the browser what version of HTML you are running

### Comments

Use `<!-- text here--> to leave notes that won't be seen on the web page.

### ID Attributes
