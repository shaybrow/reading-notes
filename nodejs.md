# Node JS

[Back to Main Page](README.md)

Node.JS is a program used to execute JavaScript code on a computer. Anytime you use an NPM command in your terminal you are using part of the Node package. If you were to type node `filename.js` in terminal it would execute any JS in that file. You use NPM to install packages either locally or attached to given projects. This tech is key to being able to code using high level JS.
