# Arrays, Loops and Imports

## Loops

This a structure that allows us to iterate through a set of operations until a certain outcome is completed.

## Imports

These allow you to use classes from other packages without rewriting the class in your code. `import java.awt.*;` `import java.awt.event.*;` `import javax.swing.*;` are the commonly used imports
