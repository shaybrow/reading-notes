# Decisions and Loops

[Back to Main Page](README.md)

- Codes can do different thing and will run different code in different situations

- Evaluations allow you to analyze values

- Decisions do different things based on your evaluations

- Loops are where you do the same steps multiple times

## Conditional Statements

1. An expression is reviewed and a value is returned

1. A conditional statement tells the code what to do in a given situation

### Comparison Operators

- `==` equal to

- `!=` not equal to

- `===` strict equal to

- `!==` strict not equal to

- `>` greater than

- `>` less than

- `>=` greater than or equal to

- `<=` less than or equal to

### Logical Operators

- Logical operators allow us to compare the results of more than one comparison operator

- `&&` Logical And checks to see whether both are true

- `||` Logical Or checks to see if either are true

- `!` Logical Not inverts a boolean

## Loops 

- `for (expression)` running a code a specific amount of times

- `while(condition)` runs a loop while a condition is true

- `do while(condition)` same as while but runs at least once no matter what

### Using While Loops

- Most often used when you don't know how many times you want a code to run
