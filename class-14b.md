[Back to Main Page](README.md)

## Origin Story 

- Julia Rozovsky went to Yale for an MBA and was assigned a study group the didn't get along well in a group format

- She joined a competition case group that got along swimingly and everyone felt comfortable throwing ideas and opinions out there

- She wasn't sure why there was such a big difference between the two groups

- She decided she wanted to study how people interact and ended up on Google's Aristotle Project

## Project Aristotle

- Google built a team of their best data analysts to research what makes a perfect team

- The rewviewed a lot of academic research on the subject and developed measuring sticks for their own teams 

- different groups had different behaviors and different measures of success that did not seem to be correlated

- no specific behavior or team norm seemed to be a key indicator of success

## University Project

- 669 people from all walks of life were put into small groups

- teams that did one project well seemed to do most projects well while groups that failed, failed often

- successful teams all had their own norms but shared high emotional intelligence and sensitivity

## Conclusion

- between the project and Aristotle it was determined that all members of the team feeling that they were in a psychologically safe environment greatly increases efficieny and employee satisfaction
