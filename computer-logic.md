## What Makes a Computer

- A machine for thinking work

### The 4 Tasks

1. Input

1. Storage

1. Process

1. Output

## Binary & Data

### 1's and 0's

- All info in a computer is stored in a boolean or bit

- The more bits you have the more info you can store

- Any number, image or letter can be represented by 1's and 0's

## Circuits and Logic

- A circuit takes an electrical signal and flips it

- Small circuits perform various logical calculations

- They can be combined to create more complex functions

## CPU, Input, Memory and Output

- To display a lettter a CPU runs thousands of instructions

- Most modern computers have multiple CPUs to perform extremely complex tasks

## Hardware and Software

- Hardware are the physical compenents inside your computer

- Software are the instructions that tell those components how to act
