# Images, Color, Text

[Back to Main Page](README.md)

## Images

- images are one of the highest imppact pieces of content you can have on your site

- pay attention to copywright

- create an images folder on your site to locally store all img you use

- `<img src="url">` is how you link an image

- `alt` provides a description for search engines and for accessibility

- `title` is the name of the image

- `height` and `width` manage the size of your img

- use jpeg, or gif formats

- make sure image is as close to original size as possible when saving img

- be efficient and don't save imgs with higher the 72px/inch resolution or ppi

- jpeg is best for images with different colors

- use gifs for imgs with few colors

- cropped imgs look tacky

- vector images scale no matter how big or small you make them

- if you want to do a transparent img use png

- use `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` to contain imgs and their shared caption

## Color

- color can be determind using rgb, hex codes, hsl, hsla and color names

- most often you will use color codes to dictate foreground and background colors

- use high contrast to pull attention to the most important things for your user to see

- use medium contrast for the long form content

- use low contrast very rarely and for the least important things that must be included

- `opacity` allows you to overlap elements or make things see thru

## Text

- formatting text is important for making sure your content is readable

- serif fonts have extra details on the end that are prefect for making long form content easier to read

- sans-serif have straight ends and look much more clear - great for small font

- mono space is used for `code` due to even spacing keeping everything aligned

- `font-family` allows you to specify what fonts should be used where

- `font size` lets you indicate how big a font should be

- `@font-font` allows you to use fonts that aren't installed on most computers

- `font-weight` lets you bold text

- `font-style` lets you change italics

- `text-transform` lets you switch between upper and lower case

- `text-decoration` lets you do things like underline and strikethrough text

- `letter-spacing` and `words-spacing` let you mess with the space between letters and words

- `text-align` tells the web page where to put that text in that lovely box
