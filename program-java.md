## How We Use It

- Grab content

- Modify that content

- Create rules

- React to things

## Scripts

- A list of instructions

- Ex. recipes, handbooks and manuals

### Writing a Script

- determine your goal

- list and order the tasks need to acheive the goal

- code each task using information your system understands

## Expressions

- Ends in a single value

- these can be dictated (x = 3)

- or calculated (x = 3 + 2)

## Operators

- Create a single value from 1+ values 

### Arithmetic

- `+`

- `-`

- `/` divsion

- `*` multiply

- `++` increase

- `--` decrease

- `%` divides 2 values and returns the remainder

- follows normal algebra order of operations

### Strings

- use `+` to join multiple strings together

### Functions

- group a series of statement together to do a task

- some require parameters or specific inputs

- return values are the result of your function

- `function wave() {arm.move (up + down)}`

- `function` is our keyword

- `wave` is the name of our function

- `{ arm.move (up + down)}` is the code that performs the function

- to call it we would use `wave();`

- some functions require inputs `wave(leftarm)`

- some functions have a result we use `return variable;` to make sure that is available
