# REST

[Back to Main Page](README.md)

- http is the language used for communication between websites

- describes the location of anything anywhere from anywhere

## What is REST

- gives a definition of a resource that provides the web page version of the resource

- other than web page an api is an example of one of these resources

- this allows us to utilize communication between multiple resources at a time

- in order to communicate with a resource you need to know the language that resource communicates in

- for a web page HTTP is esentially just getting various things
