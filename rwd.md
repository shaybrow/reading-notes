## CSS Grid Layout

- 2 dimensional grid layout systems

- Grid and flexbox together solve most usability issues with layout using CSS

- supported by all common browsers except for IE

- `display:grid` should be placed in the grid container 

- direct descendants are referred to as grid items

- grid lines are either vertical or horizontal and make up the structure of the grid

- the space between to grid lines is referred to as a grid cell

- grid tracks are the space between adjacent grid lines

- grids can be displayed block or inline

- `grid-column-start` and `grid-column-end` refer to grids lines and are used to indicated where we want items to appear

- `grid-column 'value' / 'value'` works as shorthand for start and end

- `justify-items` applies to all items in the grid and is great for centering items

- `auto-fill` will create a grid with as many items that will fit into the container
