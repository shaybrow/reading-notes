# Call Stack

[Back to Main Page](README.md)

Call stack is a process for an interpreter that it uses to resolve code that calls multiple functions. It starts at the bottom and works it's way up. Any functions that are call get added up above the intial and run when their calls are reached. Once a function is finished it's removed from the stack.
