## Variables

- Objects store their states in fields
- Instance variables are objects that store their state in non-static fields
- Class variables are any object with the static declaration meaning that the field of the variable doesn't change.
- Local variables are determined by being declared inside a function
- Parameters are passed into functions as variables

### Naming

- Use full words describing what the variable is or does
- Use camelCase

## Operators

- postfix - expr++ expr--
- unary - ++expr --expr +expr -expr ~ !
- multiplicative - * / %
- additive - + -
- shift - << >> >>>
- relational - < > <= >= instanceof
- equality - == !=
- logical AND - &&
- logical OR - ||
- ternary - ? :
- assignment - = += -= *= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>= >>>=

## Expressions, Statements and Blocks

- "An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations, which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value"
- In order to write clean code, we want to make our expressions as clear as possible
- Statements create a complete unit of execution
- A block is a group of statements that essentially functions as a single statement

## Control Flow Statements

- These are what we use to conditionally execute parts of code. Examples include if-then statements.
