# Diversity and Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## Why Women Stopped Coding

The rise of personal computers and the cultural norm of computers being toys for boys resulted in a sharp reduction in women in software development. This norm created in the 80's continues to affect the number of women in software development today. 

## Diversity in Tech

Despite slow movement away from this as the standard, tech companies are still predominantly dominated by white males.

## Why Diversity Matters to a Tech Company

- Studies have shown that the more diverse a team is the more productive they can be.

- Given that diverse teams perform better diverse companies.

- Companies that have more diverse perspectives are more flexible with approaching problems.
