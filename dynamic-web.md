# Dynamic Web Pages with Jvascript

## Writing a Script

### The Trinity

- HTML is where the content lives

- CSS is where the presentation of the content happens

- Javascript is where we can change how the page acts

### Part of Javascript

- `document.write('Good day!)`

- `document` is the object. We are calling on the website 

- `.`  is the operator. This tells the object it needs to do something

- `write('Good day!)` is the method. This is telling the object what to do and how to do it

### Statements

- A single command given to a computer. More than one is a script

### Comments 

-`/* Comment goes here*/`

- It's important to keep notes

### Variables

- similar to algebra

- `var amount`

- `var` is our key word to indicate a variable

- `amount` is the name of our variable

- `amount = 4` gives our variable amount

### Data Types

- Numeric are numbers

- string is for text and other characters

- boolean is true or false

### Variable Rules

1. Name may not start with a number

1. Name cannot contain a `-` or `.`

1. Cannot use keywords

1. Don't use variables with the same name but different casing

1. Describe the info the variable stores

1. Capitalize every word after the first
